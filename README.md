# Thinning-of-guard-zones-in-ad-hoc-network
The objective of this project is to implement guard zone in an ad hoc network and then investigate the performance measures and changes in these measures by varying the size of guard zones. Guard zone is a region around the receiver of a node where other active transmitters are inhibited from transmitting to reduce interference. First, a simple ad hoc network is constructed, then guard zone is implanted and then for this and previous configuration following models and factors are investigated: Signal to Noise plus Interference Ratio (SINR), Aggregate Interference, number of total active nodes and Okumura-Hata Model for Path Loss. Path Loss via Okumura-Hata model, Aggregate Interference and number of total active nodes are expected to decrease whereas SINR is expected to increase. Aggregate Interference has a sharp decrease with the implantation of guard zone within small sizes of guard zones, it decreases to minimal value. No. of nodes and path loss via okumura-hata model decrease organically. SINR increases and then the rate of increase also gradually increases. To conclude, the optimal value of guard zone depends on the application where in which ad hoc network is used. But it will be a point where these performance measures are optimized.
